 * Describes objects that can be composed. For example, two functions can be composed to
 * a new function. The composing may be not commutative, so there are two kinds of composing:
 * [.compose] and [.andThen], which correspond to the method
 * [Function.compose] and [Function.andThen].
 *
 *
 * A composable type is naturally associative to the operation of composing. Therefore, for any composable
 * object, a semigroup can be defined.
